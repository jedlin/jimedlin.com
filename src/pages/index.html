            <p>Currently, Jim is a Senior Software Engineer at microlending 
            marketplace <a href="http://kiva.org" target="_blank">Kiva</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>Formerly he worked with 
            <a href="http://chug.net" target="_blank">Chug</a>, a stealth startup 
            developing a vertical search engine for cars, and with 
            <a href="http://arizonabay.com/">Arizona Bay</a>, an "innovation 
            capital" firm that assists technology startups with both financial 
            resources and technical expertise. He also was a cofounder and CTO 
            of <a href="https://vimeo.com/8326766" target="_blank">
            The2ofYou</a>, a startup to help couples sustain and improve their 
            relationship.
            </p>
            
            <p>From 1998 until 2008, Jim was Technologist-in-Residence and 
            later Business Applications Architect at 
            <a href="http://www.tides.org" target="_blank">Tides</a>, a network 
            of San Francisco-based nonprofit organizations. There he assisted
            Tides organizations in choosing and implementing technology 
            solutions to further their mission of "actively promoting change 
            toward a healthy and just society."
            </p>

            <p>Before Tides, Jim was co-CEO of
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970722093436/http://www.hmg.com/" target="_blank">
            The HyperMedia Group, Inc.</a> (HMG), an interactive-media 
            custom development firm he co-founded in 1987. HMG, which 
            evolved from creating multimedia CD-ROMs to developing 
            leading-edge Web sites, was named one of the 25 fastest-growing 
            Bay Area private companies in 1996. HMG's work for clients such 
            as Equitable Life, Microsoft, Simon & Schuster, and Wells Fargo 
            was honored with numerous awards. In 1998, HMG was acquired by 
            <a href="http://www.wilsonlearning.com" target="_blank">Wilson 
            Learning Worldwide.</a>
            </p>

            <p>Earlier, Jim participated in several capacities in the emergence 
            of the personal computer industry &mdash; including as a columnist 
            for <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/" target="_blank"><i>InfoWorld</i></a>; 
            co-founder and first editor of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com" target="_blank">

            publisher Bruce & James, whose

            Wordvision</a></em> program was hailed by users and reviewers 
            for breakthrough ease-of-use. In 1977, Jim wrote and produced 
            what he believes was the first TV commercial promoting personal 
            computers.

            arts from Michigan State University and is a graduate of Northwestern
