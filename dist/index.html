                  <p>From 1998 until 2008, Jim was Technologist-in-Residence and 
                  later Business Applications Architect at

                  solutions to further their mission of "actively promoting change 
                  toward a healthy and just society."
                  </p>
      
                  <p>Before Tides, Jim was co-CEO of
                  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19970722093436/http://www.hmg.com/" target="_blank">
                  The HyperMedia Group, Inc.</a> (HMG), an interactive-media 
                  custom development firm he co-founded in 1987. HMG, which 
                  evolved from creating multimedia CD-ROMs to developing 
                  leading-edge Web sites, was named one of the 25 fastest-growing 
                  Bay Area private companies in 1996. HMG's work for clients such 
                  as Equitable Life, Microsoft, Simon & Schuster, and Wells Fargo 
                  was honored with numerous awards. In 1998, HMG was acquired by 
                  <a href="http://www.wilsonlearning.com" target="_blank">Wilson

                  </p>
      
                  <p>Earlier, Jim participated in several capacities in the emergence 
                  of the personal computer industry &mdash; including as a columnist 
                  for <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/" target="_blank"><i>InfoWorld</i></a>; 
                  co-founder and first editor of <a href="http://www.pcmag.com" target="_blank">
                  <i>PC Magazine</i></a>; and co-founder and president of software 
                  publisher Bruce & James, whose 
                  <em><a href='http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=799&type=software' target='_blank'>
                  Wordvision</a></em> program was hailed by users and reviewers 
                  for breakthrough ease-of-use. In 1977, Jim wrote and produced 
                  what he believes was the first TV commercial promoting personal 
                  computers.
